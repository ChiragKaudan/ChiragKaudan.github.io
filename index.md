## About Me

I am a PhD student at Oregon State University studying theoretical computer science.

## Research Interests

- **Combinatorics:** Graph theory especially is important to theoretical computer scientists and I spend time thinking about various problems in graph theory like extremal problems, coloring, optimization, forbidden substructures, etc.
- **Algorithms and Complexity** Algorithms for combinatorial problems and complexity theory are also of interest to me.


## Updates

- **[Aug. 2024]** I plan on creating and linking a blog containing my thoughts about (mostly) math things I study and find interesting
