## About Me

I am a PhD student at Oregon State University studying theoretical computer science.

## Research Interests

- **Combinatorics:** Graph theory is especially important to theoretical computer scientists and I spend time thinking about various problems in graph theory like extremal problems, coloring, optimization, forbidden substructures, etc.
- **Algorithms and Complexity** Algorithms for combinatorial problems and complexity theory are also of interest to me.


## Things I'm Thinking About
### I will try to keep this section udpated as frequently as possible; last update [Aug. 2024]
- I've been thinking about graph reconstruction on hidden graphs given a shortest path metric oracle. Mathieu and Zhou showed it can be done in soft O(n^3/2) query complexity. The area involves a ton of randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis, so I've been playing around with probability.

## General Updates

- **[Aug. 2024]** I've created a blog containing my thoughts about (mostly) math things I find interesting.
