## About Me

I am a PhD student at Oregon State University studying theoretical computer science, advised by [Dr. Amir Nayyeri](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~nayyeria/). 

## Research Interests

- **Combinatorics:** Within combinatorics, graph theory is especially of interest to me. I spend time thinking about various problems in graph theory; extremal problems, coloring, optimization, forbidden substructures, etc.
- **Algorithms and Complexity** Algorithms for combinatorial problems and complexity theory are also of interest to me; combinatorial structures provide a rich playground for algorithms research


## Things I'm Currently Thinking About
#### I will try to keep this section udpated as frequently as possible; last update Nov 2024
- Thinking generally still about hidden graph reconstruction allowing for different oracles; many papers start using adversarial arguments and information theoretic arguments elegantly to prove lower bounds, which is always a blast to see! These techinques seem to play nicely with graph reconstruction problem variants, but there are probably bigger, more general sledgehammer techniques in this area out there.
- Expanding from just graph reconstruction, there are a few interesting questions; using shortest path metric oracles, which properties of graphs can you verify in better than soft O(n^2) time? Connectivity properties seem natural to look at with shortest path metric oracles
  #### Aug 2024
- I've been thinking about graph reconstruction on hidden graphs given a shortest path metric oracle. Mathieu and Zhou showed it can be done in soft O(n^3/2) query complexity. The area involves a ton of randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis, so I've been playing around with probability.
- A neat conjecture in graph theory: for a nontrivial connected graph F, there exists an F-irregular graph if and only if F is not isomorphic to K2. The forward direction is easily provable and there exists a P3-irregular graph, but I have no idea beyond this and I can't seem to find people seriously working on this.

## General Updates

- **[Aug. 2024]** I've created a blog containing my thoughts about (mostly) math things I find interesting.
