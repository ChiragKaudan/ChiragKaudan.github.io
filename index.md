## About Me

I am a PhD student at Oregon State University studying theoretical computer science.

## Research Interests

- **Combinatorics:** Graph theory is especially important to theoretical computer scientists and I spend time thinking about various problems in graph theory like extremal problems, coloring, optimization, forbidden substructures, etc.
- **Algorithms and Complexity** Algorithms for combinatorial problems and complexity theory are also of interest to me.


## Things I'm Currently Thinking About
#### I will try to keep this section udpated as frequently as possible; last update Aug. 2024
- I've been thinking about graph reconstruction on hidden graphs given a shortest path metric oracle. Mathieu and Zhou showed it can be done in soft O(n^3/2) query complexity. The area involves a ton of randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis, so I've been playing around with probability.
- A neat conjecture in graph theory; For a nontrivial connected graph F, there exists an F-irregular graph if and only if F is not isomorphic to K2. The forward direction is easily provable and there exists a P3-irregular graph, but I have no idea beyond this and I can't seem to find people seriously working on this

## General Updates

- **[Aug. 2024]** I've created a blog containing my thoughts about (mostly) math things I find interesting.
